### 4. Insecure API Endpoints (CRITICAL)
**Risk Level:** 游댮 Critical  
**CVSS Score:** 8.3  

**Description:**
Missing API endpoints with proper validation and authorization, creating potential security gaps.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized data access
- Data manipulation
- API abuse
- Information disclosure

**Fix Implemented:**
- Created secure API routes with proper validation:
  - `GET /api/polls` - Paginated poll retrieval
  - `POST /api/polls` - Secure poll creation
  - `POST /api/polls/[id]/vote` - Secure voting
  - `DELETE /api/polls/[id]/vote` - Vote removal
- Implemented comprehensive input validation
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Applied rate limiting to all endpoints

**Files Created:**
- `app/api/polls/route.ts`
- `app/api/polls/[id]/vote/route.ts`

## Medium Risk Vulnerabilities

### 5. Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM)
**Risk Level:** 游리 Medium  
**CVSS Score:** 6.5  

**Description:**
The application lacked essential security headers, making it vulnerable to various client-side attacks.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive security headers in middleware:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Files Modified:**
- `middleware.ts`
- `app/layout.tsx`

### 6. Insufficient Error Handling (MEDIUM)
**Risk Level:** 游리 Medium  
**CVSS Score:** 5.8  

**Description:**
Poor error handling could lead to information disclosure and poor user experience.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- Implemented proper error logging without exposing sensitive information
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Created fallback error handling for unexpected scenarios

### 7. Missing CSRF Protection (MEDIUM)
**Risk Level:** 游리 Medium  
**CVSS Score:** 5.5  

**Description:**
No CSRF protection was implemented for state-changing operations.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added CSRF protection through proper authentication checks
- Implemented secure session management
- Added origin validation in API routes

## Low Risk Vulnerabilities
